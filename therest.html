Step 3

Design the Lesson Plan
Break the learning goals down into small tasks that can be incorporated into your hack jam. With your team of volunteers and/or co-facilitators think about ways to embed assessment directly into the activity so that it is both a fun design activity and a meaningful learning experience.
Start out by designing ice-breakers and opportunities to get people to contribute to the design challenge and work collectively to make something by the end of the day.
Many events allow for some dedicated instruction combined with experimentation time. We have included a sample lesson plan for you to use as is, or as a template for your event’s theme of the day.

TIP: Get familiar with some of the terms used commonly when talking about webmaking.

Sample Lesson Plan

Superheroes of the Open Web
Synopsis: In this hands-on workshop, learners aged 10 and up play, deconstruct and modify websites in order to understand how to create content for, and build, webpages. Participants use the Mozilla Hackasaurus tools to guide them through the process of remixing images, text and style while learning basic web design and programming concepts. Participants experiment with the X-Ray Goggles bookmarklet, a tool that allows users to see and manipulate the HTML and CSS that make up webpages.
Using the Goggles and other open source web-based tools, participants will respond to design challenges that offer them a chance to use these newly acquired programming skills.
Duration: This three-part lesson plan can either take one full day or be broken up into separate modules.
￼Badges
Learning today happens everywhere, not just in the classroom. But it’s often difficult to get recognition for skills and achievements that happen outside of school. Mozilla’s Open Badges project is working to solve that problem, making it easy for anyone to issue, earn and display badges across the web through a shared infrastructure that’s free and open to all.
The result: helping learners everywhere display 21st century skills, unlock career and educational opportunities, and level up in their life and work.
Assessment: A Hackasaurus Superheroes of the Open Web Learning Rubric is available for learner assessment at the end of this section.

Module 1

Hack the Robot Dance
1. Overview
The goal of this activity is for learners to understand that hacking has always been a key element in the creative process, and that it is a constructive col- laborative activity, not a destructive one. Participants will learn how to hack a popular dance from the 80s to design a brand new dance.
2. Materials you’ll need
<li>Speakers
<li>Computer with reliable internet connection and unblocked access to YouTube <li>Projector
<li>Video: How To Do The Robot (Totally Rad 80’s Dances)
http://youtu.be/E-_iUHY8RBs
3. How to play
<li>Participants form a circle
<li>Facilitator plays the “How To Do The Robot (Totally Rad 80’s Dances)” video <li>Facilitator tells the group that they are now going to hack the dance,
starting with examining all of the steps in the dance
<li>Everyone practices the dance in its entirety
<li>The first participant finds one step of the dance to change
<li>The participant demonstrates the hacked dance in the circle
<li>The person to the left of the initial hacker must hack that move or repeat it
<li>If hacking the move, the person has to demonstrate the new dance move they are adding or replacing
<li>Repeat until everyone in the circle has danced <li>When the last person in the circle has made
their hack, everyone in the whole circle needs to try out the new dance. If there is extra time, go around the circle again
4. Discussion
After the dance party is over, direct guiding questions to participants to help identify the steps
to hacking. Write definition/key words that participants come up with on the board/poster paper.
<li>How did you hack the dance? Discuss the rules — what were they?

What actions were you doing while hacking?
Discuss the mechanics and dynamic systems — Break down the activity, first they looked at the dance, then they changed bits and pieces of it until it became a new dance. One person made a change which affected the entire dance.
<li>What was the goal of the activity?
Discuss goal — creating a new dance by hacking
<li>What made the dance fun? Discuss creativity and co-developing the project. <li>How do you think hacking a dance will be similar to hacking a website?
Discuss what defines hacking and transition onto the next topic

5. Introduction to badges
Explain to participants that they will be able to collect paper badges for their accomplishments throughout the hack jam. At the end of a module, participants will “pledge” or apply for badges to gain specific super powers. They must successfully complete the pledged task in front of a peer mentor or facilitator who will award them the badge to show they’ve earned
their superpower.

Module 2

Try on Your X-Ray Goggles
1. Overview
The goal is for participants to create their first webpage by hacking and tinkering with an existing webpage. Participants may pledge for two types of badges — the Navigator badge for learners who are new to web browsing and the Remixer badge for learners who are already familiar with web browsing and are moving on to hacking HTML.
2. Materials you’ll need
<li>Computers with high-speed Internet connection
<li>Computers available for participants/team of participants
<li>Hackasaurus X-Ray Goggles installed on a modern web browser
e.g. FireFox, Chrome, Safari, Opera, with the latest browser versions updated
(Please note: Hackasaurus currently does not support Internet Explorer.) <li>Projector
<li>HTML and CSS cheat sheets
3. Facilitator procedure
Demonstrate how to hack the webpage and then go over the steps in a slow, clear manner:
<li>Tell participants that they will be hacking a website
<li>Ask participants to call out the name of a website that they regularly visit <li>If no one responds or if you have slow Internet, go to google.com because
it loads fairly quickly
<li>Turn on the Goggles. You can do this by clicking on the bookmarklet
in your bookmark toolbar
<li>Using the Goggles, slowly hover the cursor over objects so that participants
can see that the tool is inspecting the code and showing the object tags for
each object
<li>Hover over an image or some text on the page and hit “R” on your keyboard <li>Keep this screen up so that participants can see that the code is revealed
at this stage
<li>Ask participants for help hacking the code. If you are editing text, ask
participants what text they would like to replace the text with; if you are changing an image ask participants to name their favorite musician and do a search for that musician online
<li>After you have acquired the assets and made the changes, hit the OK button and show everyone the hack
<li>Now, show everyone how to do this step by step and, whenever possible, refer back to the steps that you defined for hacking with the Hack this Dance module

<li>Steps:
Turn on the X-Ray Goggles bookmarklet
— Look at the code, point out the tags, attributes and elements — Find the object tags that you want to change or replace
(e.g. <p> or <img>)
— Change one part of the webpage
— Hack: hit the “commit changes” button to save changes locally
on your computer
— Share the hack: hit “T” to publish the new webpage on the Internet
4. Pledging for badges
At this point participants can pledge for either the Navigator or Remixer badge. To qualify for the Navigator badge, participants must:
<li>Open up the browser
<li>In the address bar, type:http://navigator.hackasaurus.org
<li>Complete the mission to receive the badge <li>Superpower earned: Enhanced web agility
To qualify for the Remixer badge, participants need to complete the following tasks:
<li>Go to www.google.com
<li>Using the Goggles, replace the Google logo with an image
<li>Using the Goggles, change or add text to the webpage <li>Superpower: X-ray vision
5. Discussion
At the end of the session, have participants present their new webpages, explain their work process and what they learned.

Module 3
1. Overview:
The goal is to introduce participants to an organic, interactive design process for webmaking. Participants will discuss what it means to have an open web and create fictional superhero identities and web assets (websites, content, imagery, etc.) to defend the open web. A prototyping station is available for those kids who may wish to start with an analog version. During the module, participants will pledge for several badges. During the module, participants will pledge for several badges.
2. Materials you’ll need
<li>Computers with reliable Internet connection <li>X-Ray Goggles bookmarklet installed
<li>Supplies for station activities:
Computers set up with Hackasaurus tools Paper supplies
Scissors
Glue
LegoTM blocks
Markers
Camera or computers with image editing software (e.g. Aviary http:// www.aviaryeducation.com/ or other open image editing software)
<li>A blog or another web-based repository for everyone to post their work such as www.blogger.com, www.wordpress.com or www.tumblr.com
3. Facilitator procedure
Set up the room with several stations for participants to move about organically, including:
<li>Hacking station — computers set up with Hackasaurus X-Ray Goggles
<li>Prototyping station — paper supplies, scissors, glues, markers, etc.
<li>Digital imaging station — camera or computers with digital imaging software
Frame the design challenge by having participants collectively explore prob- lems and strengths of the open web. Engage participants in a discussion about the open web by asking:
<li>What would your life be like without the web?
<li>Who made the web?
<li>How can you tell the web was made by people?
Introduce the concept of the open web:
<li>No barrier to entry — anyone can use it to make or play
<li>Transparent — you can see how it is made
<li>It doesn’t break — because it is not “owned” by any person or organization
Introduce the design challenge:
We benefit from an open web where anyone can use, see and manipulate content on the Internet. This is a privilege that we don’t want to lose. Every so often there are things that compromise the open web, such as firewalls, or blocking functionality of web browsers. This is something that can be protected — the perfect job for a team of superheroes.
Create a superhero identity to protect the open web:
<li>Parameters:
— The superhero must have a name and visual representation
— The superhero must have a biography
— What are his/her superpowers?
— How did he/she get them?
— How do his/her superpowers help to protect the web?
— Does the superhero have a nemesis or face a particular challenge?
— Hack into a news site using the Goggles to write a story about how the character saved or protected the open web
Put the content on a webpage that was created or hacked and present it to the group at the end of the day.

Tour the stations
<li>Have participants visit the various stations and allow them to work either
in groups or individually; If possible, it is ideal to have facilitators at each station to support participants
4. Presentations
<li>Have participants talk about their superheroes and display the work they have done
<li>Following the presentations, facilitators should direct participants to other resources in their community or online to learn more about hacking and web design/development
<li>Provide individual constructive feedback during presentations

5. Pledging for badges
At each station, participants should be able to pledge for a Producer, Word- smith or Webmaker badge and nominate someone for a Peer Coder badge.
To qualify for the Producer badge, participants will need to complete the following tasks:
<li>Design the visual representation of a superhero
<li>Prepare content for the web
<li>Place content on a website
<li>Superpower: Design Dexterity
To qualify for the Wordsmith badge, participants will need to complete the following tasks:
Participants must complete the following tasks:
<li>Visit a news website
<li>Using the X-Ray Goggles, hack into a paragraph on the site
<li>Write a story about how the partivipant’s character saved or protected
the open web
<li>Superpower: Ciphering

To qualify for the Webmaker badge, participants will need to complete the following tasks and show a peer mentor or facilitator the website, who will then distribute the badge:
<li>Open up WebPad at http://webpad.hackasaurus.org/
<li>Using the content that you created (the bio, news article and visual art), create a website
<li>For some helpful snippets of code that could be included in your site, visit Hackbook at http://hackbook.hackasaurus.org/
<li>Superpower: Enhanced marksmanship
Note: The WebPad and Hackbook are in an experimental state as they’re still in development
To qualify for the Peer Coder badge, participants need to be nominated
by a peer at the jam. A peer coder is someone who:
<li>Demonstrates ability to work collaboratively and/or
<li>Demonstrates ability to code HTML and/or CSS with a collaborator and/or <li>Assists another participant with their code
<li>Superpower: Invincibility
